# Phasmo-Bingo
## Rules
Makes a *Phasmophobia* Bingo card. The rules? If you get a ghost **twice**, **restart**.

You will want to bash your skull through a wall. It's part of the experience. Ain't paying for the hospital bills tho, that's a **you** problem.

To **spice things up**, you could choose **"Random"** as your map and/or **random difficulty**.
